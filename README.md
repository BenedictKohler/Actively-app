# Actively Mobile App

## Description:
A social networking app developed using the Flutter Framework that connects users together based on their sporting interests and location. Uses Google Maps API for location filtering and Google Cloud Firestore for storing data.

## Getting Started
Assuming that you have Android Studio installed, clone this repository using version control or by typing `git clone https://github.com/BenedictKohler/Actively-app.git` in a terminal/console. After completing this step open the **pubspec.yaml file** and run Pub get if you are using Android Studio or alternatively you can manually install the packages in the dependency section.

## Running the program:
After installing the dependencies, you can run the app using virtualization software or alternatively you can enable developer mode on your phone and then run it on that.
Once the program is running you will need to create an account in order to login. From here you will be prompted to select your sporting interests and find your location so that you will be able to connect to other users. After this you will then be able to find and chat with other users as well as update your profile and favorites section.
